			<h3>About Me</h3>
      			<p>
				I completed my Bachelors in Science from Nepal, and worked in Pharmaceutical Company. Later on 2009, for further education,
				I came to US, and graduated from University of Virginia.
				After graduation, it's been a roller-coaster ride - got privilege to work in different domain and technology.
      			</p>
      			<p>
				Technology was always fascinating to me, and always tried learning new things related to it. To keep up with pace of Technical evolution and not to be left behind,
				Lately I have started my learning journey in ThinkFul, as Software Engineer. Its has been challanging , hard but fun to learn things here.

        			If you are looking for a person who's passoniate to learn new things, knows about current technologies, team player, and obviously software-developer, you can contact me via any channel reflected in contact me section.

			I can very well communicate in
